%\noindent\textbf{Test case specification identifier: wp31-api-ts01-zephyr01-tcs01}%insert file name here without extension '.tex'

%Purpose:
%To define a test case identified by a test design specification.

%Outline:
%A test case specification shall have the following structure:
%a) Test case specification identifier;
%b) Test items;
%c) Input specifications;
%d) Output specifications;
%e) Environmental needs;
%f) Special procedural requirements;
%g) Intercase dependencies.
%The sections shall be ordered in the specified sequence. Additional sections may be included at the end. If
%some or all of the content of a section is in another document, then a reference to that material may be listed
%in place of the corresponding content. The referenced material must be attached to the test case specification
%or available to users of the case specification.
%Since a test case may be referenced by several test design specifications used by different groups over a long
%time period, enough specific information must be included in the test case specification to permit reuse.
%Details on the content of each section are contained in the following subclauses.


\subsubsection{Test Items}
%Identify and brieÃy describe the items and features to be exercised by this test case.
%For each item, consider supplying references to the following test item documentation:
%a) Requirements specification;
%b) Design specification;
%c) Users guide;
%d) Operations guide;
%e) Installation guide.

Using the SAGA API, this test will run the EDF Application Zephyr on the
 target machine, regularly monitoring its state, checking whether it
 is still running or not till its nominal or in error termination. It
 will also test the cancellation of an ongoing application.

\subsubsection{Input Specifications}
%Specify each input required to execute the test case. Some of the inputs will be specified by value (with
%tolerances where appropriate), while others, such as constant tables or transaction files, will be specified by
%name. Identify all appropriate databases, files, terminal messages, memory resident areas, and values passed
%by the operating system.
%Specify all required relationships between inputs (e.g., timing).

Input is generated by the test program itself. No additional input
is required.

Input needed by the application Zephyr are read from a ``fort.55''
file. This file must be present in the same directory from where
the test program is run.

\subsubsection{Output Specifications}
%Specify all of the outputs and features (e.g., response time) required of the test items. Provide the exact value
%(with tolerances where appropriate) for each required output or feature.

The test program prints its output on the
standard output stream  as reproduced further in this document.

The application Zephyr dumps its text output into a ``fort.66'' file.


\subsubsection{Environmental Needs}

%\paragraph{Hardware}
%Specify the characteristics and configurations of the hardware required to execute this test case (e.g.,
%132 character 24 line CRT).

%TODO


\paragraph{Software}
%Specify the system and application software required to execute this test case. This may include system software
%such as operating systems, compilers, simulators, and test tools. In addition, the test item may interact
%with application software.

The test program  spawns, monitors and
cancels an actual EDF application : Zephyr.

The hardware and software testing environment  is the one described at section \refexpdoc{api:env}


%\paragraph{Other}
%Specify any other requirements such as unique facility needs or specially trained personnel.

%\subsubsection{Special Procedural Requirements}
%Describe any special constraints on the test procedures that execute this test case. These constraints may
%involve special set up, operator intervention, output determination procedures, and special wrap up.

%\subsubsection{Intercase Dependencies}
%List the identifiers of test cases that must be executed prior to this test case. Summarize the nature of the
%dependencies.
