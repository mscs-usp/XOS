\subsubsection{Summary}

The application can restart correctly, but a set of errors related to server sockets are produced.


\subsubsection{Incident Description}
When the application restarts, the server socket cannot be opened (probably an identifier deleted by the kernel).

The error message is related to Java classes, and it indicates that the socket identifier is not available anymore.

\subsubsection{Impact}
%If known, indicate what impact this incident will have on test plans, test design specifications, test procedure
%specifications, or test case specifications.
The main application would have be changed in order to cope with this issue. The failure in open server sockets would have to be controlled by the application, reopening it in case the binding fails.
