%\noindent\textbf{Test case specification identifier: }%insert file name here without extension '.tex'

%Purpose:
%To define a test case identified by a test design specification.

%Outline:
%A test case specification shall have the following structure:
%a) Test case specification identifier;
%b) Test items;
%c) Input specifications;
%d) Output specifications;
%e) Environmental needs;
%f) Special procedural requirements;
%g) Intercase dependencies.
%The sections shall be ordered in the specified sequence. Additional sections may be included at the end. If
%some or all of the content of a section is in another document, then a reference to that material may be listed
%in place of the corresponding content. The referenced material must be attached to the test case specification
%or available to users of the case specification.
%Since a test case may be referenced by several test design specifications used by different groups over a long
%time period, enough specific information must be included in the test case specification to permit reuse.
%Details on the content of each section are contained in the following subclauses.


\subsubsection{Test Items}
%Identify and brie��y describe the items and features to be exercised by this test case.
%For each item, consider supplying references to the following test item documentation:
%a) Requirements specification;
%b) Design specification;
%c) Users guide;
%d) Operations guide;
%e) Installation guide.
This test will evaluate the checkpointing and restarting mechanism provided by WP2.1. To this end, the SAP WebAS will be used as an example for a complex and large business application.

\subsubsection{Input Specifications}
%Specify each input required to execute the test case. Some of the inputs will be specified by value (with
%tolerances where appropriate), while others, such as constant tables or transaction files, will be specified by
%name. Identify all appropriate databases, files, terminal messages, memory resident areas, and values passed
%by the operating system.
%Specify all required relationships between inputs (e.g., timing).
The application will not have specific input. Aim of the test is to see whether a checkpointing can be performed and the application restarted. Input are some random user clicks to find out whether the application is active.

\subsubsection{Output Specifications}
%Specify all of the outputs and features (e.g., response time) required of the test items. Provide the exact value
%(with tolerances where appropriate) for each required output or feature.
There is no specific output to the system. Just that some tabs can be chosen by users or that some entries can be filled with text. It is more a kind of test whether the system is active at all.

\subsubsection{Environmental Needs}

\paragraph{Hardware}
%Specify the characteristics and configurations of the hardware required to execute this test case (e.g.,
%132 character 24 line CRT).
A single x86\_64 machine with at least 4~GB of RAM and 150~GB of available disc space is required.

\paragraph{Software}
%Specify the system and application software required to execute this test case. This may include system software
%such as operating systems, compilers, simulators, and test tools. In addition, the test item may interact
%with application software.
The following software is required:
\begin{itemize}
\item Linux kernel 2.6.16 or higher
\item BLCR 0.6.1 with the XtreemOS modifications
\item SAP WebAS 6.40
\end{itemize}
